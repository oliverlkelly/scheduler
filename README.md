# Work Day Scheduler

## The Task

To create a functional workday scheduler to allow users to plan out a busy workday. The scheduler should present the current time in red, future time in green and past time in grey, and should allow for text to be saved in the event areas in local storage so as to be retrievable.

This project allowed me to learn more about the following;
- Javascript implimentation and use
- The ability to take a set of criteria and create a website that follows those criteria
- A deeper understanding of local storage and manipulating local storage
- A deeper understanding of Javascript and it things you can do with it

## Installation

This project is a webpage, and is deployed on github pages through the following link:
    https://oliverlkelly.github.io/scheduler/

The site can also be deployed locally by pulling the file structure to your local machine and opening the index.html file in your browser of preference.

## Usage

This project can be used as a website. There are other components of the site that can be used for reference, such as the methods and logic used to present the questions to the user and the way scores are saved and cleared.
